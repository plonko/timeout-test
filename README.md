## Notes on test

I didn't manage to get in:

- The "reasons" functionality
- The drinks

I wanted to go vanilla js but getting the tooling for ES6, Webpack and testing together was taking too long so I just went for the sledgehammer.

I would have liked to have added:

- PropTypes
- Conditional rendering (If array empty..)
- Smaller unit tests, smaller functions
- Less bad naming, I called locations venues and then places..
- Better performance
- Loading from API

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
